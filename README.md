**Submitted to**: Simpósio Brasileiro de Educação em Computação (EduComp) 2026

**Abstract**: Ethics education is increasingly important in computing due to technology’s societal impact. This paper reports a teaching experience in Ethics and Legislation in Computing at [ANONYMIZED FOR REVIEW] university, using a hybrid model combining traditional lectures with active service-learning. Students applied concepts through extension activities at a local school and online via Instagram, and selected topics used a flipped classroom approach. These methods promoted engagement, peer interaction, and autonomous learning. Results indicate that hybrid and service-learning strategies are effective for teaching ethics in computing, enhancing both conceptual understanding and students’ ability to apply ethical principles in real-world scenarios.
